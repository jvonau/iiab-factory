OS TIPS & TRICKS: click the above link (that ends in .txt) for important
recommendations on how to PREPARE & SECURE YOUR OS.

WARNING: NOOBS IS *NOT* SUPPORTED, as its partitioning is very different.
On a Raspberry Pi, [WE RECOMMEND YOU INSTALL THE LATEST RASPBERRY PI OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md)
To attempt IIAB 7.2 on another Linux see the [full/manual instructions](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#do-everything-from-scratch)

An Ethernet cable is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED during installation, as this is more
reliable than Wi-Fi (and faster too!)  WARNING: IF YOU CONNECT YOUR IIAB'S
INTERNAL WIFI TO THE INTERNET OVER 5 GHz, YOU'LL PREVENT OLDER LAPTOPS/
PHONES/TABLETS (WHICH REQUIRE 2.4 GHz) FROM CONNECTING TO YOUR IIAB'S
INTERNAL HOTSPOT.  See: "wifi_up_down: True" in /etc/iiab/local_vars.yml<!--  If however you must install over Wi-Fi,
remember to run "iiab-hotspot-on" after IIAB installation, TO ACTIVATE YOUR
RASPBERRY PI's INTERNAL WIFI HOTSPOT (thereby killing Internet connectivity!)-->

        Thanks For Building Your Own Library To Serve One & All
